#### The Digital  Apprenticeship Program Cohort I Software Development Challenge Solution

> The app is an SPA solution to the cohort I software development solution from the Digital Apprenticeship Program sponsored by <b>UK Kenya Tech Hub, The ThunderBird Scool of global management and UKaid</b>`

### Motivation

	* [React Js][1] - A free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.
	* [Tailwindcss][2] - A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces
